Frixel is a finite element analysis program thatâ€™s so easy a 5 year old could use it. Provided only a closed boundary representation and location for core, Frixel generates a 2 dimensional grid and runs structural analysis on it. You can tweak gravitation magnitude and lateral wind force to see how your designs perfom under different loading conditions. Additionaly, it can run structural topology optimization to improve its mechanical performance.

## Funcitonality
- A power-up for architect-engineer collaboration.
- A great way to test and guide options in early stage design.
- Fast. You can quickly get an understanding of structural behavior.
- Topology optimization for minimal displacement.
- Platform agnostic

## Context
Frixel was developed from scratch under 24 intense hours at the [beyondAEC Hackathon](https://beyondaec.tech) July 2018, in Boston MA. Developers were:

- [Leland Jobson](https://github.com/lelandjobson) CORE Studio | Thornton Tomasetti
- [Emil Poulsen](https://github.com/EmilPoulsen) CORE Studio | Thornton Tomasetti

## Tech Stack
- [GeneticSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp) - Genetic algorithm library.
- [SharpFE](https://github.com/iainsproat/SharpFE) - Finite element analysis library.
- WPF - Windows native UI.

## Use Frixel
- Clone the source code and build it using Visual studio or download the binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/EmilPoulsen/Frixel/releases).
- Open up Rhinoceros 6.
- Install the plugin by drag and drop the `Frixel.Rhinoceros.rhp` to the Rhino viewport.
- Type `Frixel` in the Rhino command window.

## Notes
- Platform agnostic, prototype for Rhino 6
- Needs a special build of SharpFE.Core.dll, which is included in the lib folder.

## Roadmap
- Make optimization robust/verify output
- Accurate structural quantaties as input/output (not just relative numbers)
- Develop standalone version with sketch functionality
